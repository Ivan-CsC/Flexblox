      <p class="problem">
        In the world of espionage, a coding language is used with symbols that
        perform simple mathematical operations. Your task is to create a mini
        compiler that interprets and executes programs written in this symbol
        language. The operations of the language are as follows: "#" Increases
        the numeric value by 1. "@" Decreases the numeric value by 1. "*"
        Multiplies the numeric value by itself. "&" Prints the current numeric
        value. The initial numeric value is 0 and the operations should be
        applied in the order in which they appear in the string of symbols.
