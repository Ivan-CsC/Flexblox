        ** Hackers Damage File System ** In a world where information is power,
        a hacker known as Savipo Yatar discovers a series of files on a highly
        protected server. These files contain secrets that could change the
        course of history. But there's a problem: some of the files are fake,
        designed to deceive intruders. Savipo Yatar must quickly determine which
        files are real and which are fake. Each file has a name with two parts,
        separated by a hyphen (-). The first part is an alphanumeric string, and
        the second is achecksum, which is a string formed by the characters that
        only appear once in the first part and in the order in which they
        appear. Write a program that determines whether a file is real or fake
        based on these rules. Examples: File name: xyzz33-xy Result: ✅ Real
        (The checksum is valid) File name: abcca1-ab1 Result: ❌ Fake (The
        checksum should be b1, it's incorrect) File name: abbc11-ca Result: ❌
        Fake (The checksum should be ac, the order is incorrect) Each line
        indicates the file name and its corresponding checksum, separated by a
        hyphen (-).
