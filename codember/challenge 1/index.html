        ** The Challenge ** A spy is sending encrypted messages. Your mission is
        to create a program that decodes the messages. The messages are words
        separated by spaces like this: cat dog dog car Cat doG sun We need the
        program to return the number of times each word appears in the message,
        regardless of whether it is in uppercase or lowercase. The result will
        be a text string with the word and the number of times it appears in the
        message, in this format: cat2dog3car1sun1 The words are sorted by their
        first appearance in the message!
